XML
	What XML stands for? What is the expansion for the abbreviation XML?
	eXtensible Markup Language
	---------------------------


1999
	XML was introduced.	
	Microsoft presented white paper in W3C		(world wide web consortium). 
	W3C is responsible for approving or rejecting web standards

	Microsoft recommended to use XML as a standard for information interchange.
	It was not accepted by W3C in the beginning. Then microsoft did some changes and presented again. in 1999, W3C approved XML as a standard for interchanging the information across data sources (heterogenous)

imagine
1) Kuppuri Chandana has Oracle database in their computer
2) Manasa has MySql db in their computer
3) I have IBM DB2 database in my computer

We three people have 3 different type of databases (this is called heterogenous data sources)

we are not having homogenous data sources

In this scenario, I want Kuppuri and Manasa to send their data to me
I need to import their data into my DB2 database

Solution:
----------	
Both of them should EXPORT data from their database
I have to IMPORT data into my database

when they export data, what format they choose to export
then they obtain a dump file. That file should be given to me.

I should use that file to import the data into my database

Before 1999, what was the format we were using to export data?????????
	CSV

aNy idea? what is CSV?
	Comma Separated Value

1, Raja, Sivakumar, 21
2, Abdul, Raheem, 22
3, John, Abraham, 20


The above info is a CSV

can you tell me, what is the age of Abdul?????
	a human being can find the age of abdul as 22

But for a program, it is not possible

<STUDENTS>
	<STUDENT>
		<ID>1</ID>
		<FIRSTNAME>Raja</FIRSTNAME>
		<LASTNAME>Sivakumar</LASTNAME>
		<AGE>21</AGE>
	</STUDENT>
	<STUDENT>
		<ID>2</ID>
		<FIRSTNAME>Abdul</FIRSTNAME>
		<LASTNAME>Raheem</LASTNAME>
		<AGE>22</AGE>
	</STUDENT>
	<STUDENT>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<FIRSTNAME>John</FIRSTNAME>
		<LASTNAME>Abraham</LASTNAME>
		<AGE>20</AGE>
	</STUDENT>
</STUDENTS>

can you tell me the age of Abdul Raheem??? (by looking at the above xml code?)
what is the age of a student, whose ID is 2 ???

XML is more comprehensive when compared to CSV?

csv is not self explanatory?
	self explanation is provided by meta data. there was no meta data in CSV
but in XML,
	every data is self explanatory by the TAGS/ elements

There are always misconception like confusion with HTML when they start learning XML
so it is important to compare HTML and XML

HTML
	is meant for presentation. (Whatever we code in HTML is for display purpose)
XML
	is meant for representation	(not for display purpose) for definition of data

Both are Markup language. Thats why confused
Both are based or derived from SGML		Standard Generalized Markup Language
	SGML has a vast vocabulary and also allows user defined tags.\

HTML is predefined set of tags
XML is user defined tags

What is the need for XML?
	There was a limitation in the application development.
	Applications were developed in different languages
		C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, VC++ etc 
	Every language had different binary code. 
	They were not interoperable.	Means, they cannot interact with each other
	can java program method, call a method of visual basic program method?	NO

That time, Enterprises Integration was a trend.
	Ex: we should be able to withdraw money from Any atm??????
		Before 1999, there were ATMs that accept only VISA or only Master Card 

	Because, if we have visa card, we go to master card ATM, they cannot update the database of visa. Because that is different program done in different language.

	Now, you understand the problem?????

	1999 - 2001 		This was a period, where, language interoperability was taken as a challenge and lot of efforts put on these new invention.

	Finally, in 2001, W3C introduced SOA		Service Oriented Architecture.

	Thats when WEB SERVICES were introduced. 
	1) Web services are programs that can be coded in one language. But can be accessed from other languages also

The main reason for this interoperability was XML.

	Program 1: created in visual basic, calls the method of another program created in Java. 
		OMG, how is it possible???????????
		the information sent between these two programs was in the format of XML


They were looking for a format that is understood by any language?
	text is the only format understood by any language.

but in text, business logic or data type restriction is not there. any value is accepted by text.
but XML offers technique to validate the data present in a text also.

What is the TD? when the TD is 1?

difference between HTML and XML



XML data is a plain text. Understood by any programming language
XML allows validation of data present in the tags. Each tag can restrict the type of data present.

XML alone, cannot do this validation. 

We have to use techniques like

DTD/ XSD validators

CSS/ XSL for formating the information while presenting in browser


XML is a text based markup language that is used to represent information that can be interchanged across heterogenous data sources or applications

-------------------------------	
<a href="www.google.com" >Google</a>

Building blocks for XML document:

1) Element		tags are elements in XML documents		here, a is the element
2) Attribute		here, href is the attribute
3) attribute value	here, www.google.com is the value of the attribute
4) content		here Google is the content
5) empty tags		example in html:		<br/>	
			the empty tags end with /		they do not have end tag
			they do not have start and end tag. Both tags are same empty tag
6) Entities
			in html:		&nbsp;		is an example for entities
				Why we need entities?
			there are some symbols used in XML that cannot be used as content
			for example:
				<formula>a &lt; b</formula>

			&lt;		is less than
			&gt;		is greater than

7) namespace
			you can compare this namespace concept with package concept in java.
			while java packages group the classes
			xml namespaces group the type definitions	(user defined types)
8) comments
			<!--	-->			in any markup language, comments


NOW,
	if you create an XML document, basically, it should be WELL FORMED

what is WELLFORMEDNESS?
There are some basic rules that a XML file must comply. 
1) tags must be nested properly
2) case sensitive. (values inside "" can be any case. no issues. ELEMENTS, ATTRIBUTES are case sensitive)
		means, opening tag and closing tag must be same case
		<FIRSTNAME>Raja</firstname>		THIS IS NOT ALLOWED
3) the values of attributes must be in double quotes. EVEN IF IT IS A NUMBER
		<EMPLOYEE ID="1">			here, 1 is also inside double quotes

4) empty tags end with /
		<BR/>
5) There must be only ONE root element in a document. All elements are inside that root element only
	
Check what are the rules for well formed ness of XML document.

How will you check the wellformed ness of a XML document?
	if you open a XML file in browser, then Browser can check well formed ness

save the file with .xml as extension

open the file in a browser

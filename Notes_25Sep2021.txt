Yesterday,
	we learned XML
		Building block of XML
		DTD
		XSD
			namespace
			schemaLocation
			elements, attributes
			complexType
			simpleType
			sequence, all, choice
			min, max
			datatypes:		string, integer, positiveInteger, nonNegativeInteger

		if you see XSD language, it is by default camelCase		first letter is lower case, next every word first letter in upper case
			
		parsers!
			what is the need for parsers?
				Parsers are used to read xml document using programs like java program or javascript
		2 parsers we learn in XML module:
			SAX		xml file, java program for handler, java program main method
			DOM

Lets discuss what is DOM?
-------------------------
	Expansion for DOM:
			Document Object Model
				The aim of DOM is to represent the HTML/XML document as an object.
				If we can represent anything as an object, then we can manipulate that object.
				So if we represent an XML document as an object, we can access any element or even manipulate (insert update delete)

	You know javascript.
		in javascript,
			document.getElementById("txt1").value;		//do you remember? This is DOM program

	so, if you access a XML document using DOM program, you will be able to do the same as above!

we need to parse an xml file to get DOM object	(Document)
	File f=new File("input.xml");
	DocumentBuilderFactory dbf=DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
	DocumentBuilder db=dbf.newDocumentBuilder();
	Document doc=db.parse(f);

		//this doc is the DOM that represents the xml document as an object

	NodeList nList=doc.getElementsByTagName("student");
